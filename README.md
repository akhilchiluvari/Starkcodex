# Starkcodex
ðŸš€ StarkCodex is my personal HTML wiki-style cheatbook project. Itâ€™s a hand-crafted reference site where every HTML tag gets its own dedicated page with:  âœ… What it does  âœ… When to use it  âœ… Syntax &amp; examples  âœ… Rendered output  The goal: Learn HTML to perfection, build a clean developer reference hub, and level up as a full-stack + AI innovator.
